## Current Task

Given the existing code and infrastructure (mongodb hosted on Atlas), Prisma, NestJS, and Angular... how can we implement a user registration and login system? I want to use Passport.js for authentication. Please give me an outline of the steps to take, and ask me for clarification questions as needed. Before starting, and at milestones along the way, please ask me for permission to proceed.
