## Current Task

Our Prisma and User API health check endpoint is not working. We need to fix it. When testing the endpoint in Postman, I keep getting:

{
"message": "Price Alert User API is running as of Jan 18, 2025 6:23 PM",
"databaseStatus": "Connected",
"companiesCount": 0,
"randomCompanyName": "No companies found"
}

which indicates no companies are found even though there are companies in the database. See screenshot.
