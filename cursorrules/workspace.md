# Price Alert Cursor Rules

Purpose: Get notified when a stock, ETF, crypto or precious metal reaches a certain price so that you can buy or sell.

## Requirements

- This is a pnpm workspace, do not use npm or yarn
- Use 'pn' instead of 'pnpm' since I have it aliased
- Don't start any ui or backend servers, I will do that manually
- Before starting any new task, always start with an outline of proposed steps. And ask me for permission to proceed.
