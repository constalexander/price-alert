# Price Alert Workspace

## Requirements

- Use pnpm, not npm or yarn. This is a pnpm workspace.
- Always check the current working directory first before running any commands.
- Don't start any ui or backend servers, I will do that manually.
- Before starting any new task, always start with an outline of proposed steps. Ask me for clarification questions as needed. And ask me for permission to proceed.
