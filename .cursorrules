## Current Task

Let's enhance the Metal Price Alert component to allow users to input a decimal value for the price alert. Let's use the Decimal.js library to handle the decimal values. Let's validate the input to ensure it's a valid decimal number according to the currency format. Let's also add a "Save" button to the component that will save the price alert to the database. For now, the "save to database" button will call a mock function that will simulate the save operation from the Angular service.
