## Current Task

Given the existing code and infrastructure (mongodb hosted on Atlas), Prisma, NestJS, and Angular... how can we implement a user registration and login system? I want to use Passport.js for authentication. Please give me an outline of the steps to take, and ask me for clarification questions as needed. Before starting, and at milestones along the way, please ask me for permission to proceed.

Here's what we've done so far:

1. Created User model in Prisma with necessary fields
2. Set up basic Passport.js authentication in NestJS backend
   - Local strategy for username/password
   - JWT strategy for token auth
3. Created user registration endpoints
4. Created the registration form UI component with:
   - Email and password validation
   - Dark theme integration
   - Dialog-based presentation
   - Form validation
5. Created AuthService with:
   - JWT token management
   - Registration/login methods
   - Authentication state management
   - Platform-aware localStorage usage
   - Proper TypeScript interfaces in core/models
6. Enhanced Registration Component with:
   - Proper form validation
   - Loading states
   - Error handling
   - Reactive form best practices
   - PrimeNG UI integration
   - Dialog-based presentation
7. Created login form component

Still Needed:

- Implement route guards for protected routes
- Add user session management
- Add logout functionality in the UI
- Add email verification functionality
- Add password reset functionality
- Implement role-based access control (SUPER_USER vs USER)
- Add proper error messages for specific failure cases
- Add user profile page/settings
- Add proper JWT token refresh mechanism
